Slides for my GUADEC 2019 talk about GNOME Mobile

### Abstract

GNOME Mobile has come a long way since last year's GUADEC. We now have most of the widgets to make most apps adaptive, i.e. work well across all form factors from phone, to tablet, to desktop.

In this talk I'll give an overview of the most important adaptive design patterns, how existing apps are using them, and how you can use them in your own apps.
